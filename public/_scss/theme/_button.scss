// Button Styles
// =============

// As a convention, buttons should only be used for actions while hyperlinks are to be used for objects. For instance, "Download" should be a button while "recent activity" should be a link.
// Button styles can be applied to anything with the `btn` class applied. However, typically you'll want to apply these to only `a` and `button` elements.


/* Provides extra visual weight and identifies the primary action in a set of buttons.

    <button class="btn btn-primary">Primary</button> */
